The name of my app is called 'TO-DO.' It is a website where users can create an account and build a to-do list. 

- Users can update, delete, and cross off their todos and may add as many todos as they would like. There is a new random trivia fact displayed at the top of the page each 
time the user logs in and each time the user refreshes the page. 

- To build this app I used Javascript and the PERN stack: PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node. 

- To get the random trivia fact, I used the Facts API from API Ninjas: https://api-ninjas.com/api/facts

Standard User Flow:
- When a user first visits the site, they will be faced with the landing page, which consists of a welcome message and links to the register and login pages.
- Once a user either logs in or registers, they will see the homepage which contains their empty todo list and the trivia fact as well as a logout button.
- When the user is done viewing and manipulating their todo list, they can logout and their todo list will be saved for when they login again.
